Using Promise, write a code that will form 2 consecutive requests for different json files (data.json, data2.json).
Sample data.json file:

{
"children": ["Jack", "Jacky", "Alexandr"]
}
Sample data2.json file:

{
"children": ["Anna", "Ivan", "Alena"]
}

It is necessary to glue the 2 obtained arrays and output the result to the console.
Console output: ["Jack", "Jacky", "Alexandr", "Anna", "Ivan", "Alena"]
