Create a SuperMath class with a check (obj) method, the obj parameter of which has properties X, Y, znak.

The check method must confirm from the user whether he wants to perform an action znak with X and Y. If - yes, do the mathematical action znak (which is described in the class), otherwise - request the input of new data via the input () method from the SuperMath class.
