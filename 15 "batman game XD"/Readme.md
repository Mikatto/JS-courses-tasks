Create a block in the center of the screen. When you click on the arrows, the block moves in the corresponding direction. The block must "abut against the screen", i.e. can't go beyond the screen.

1) the block does not fall out of the screen
2) at each "cutting" into the wall - the block jumps by step * 2 pixels in the opposite direction.
3) With each jump - in the middle of the block appears the inscription "BEMS", which disappears after 2 seconds
